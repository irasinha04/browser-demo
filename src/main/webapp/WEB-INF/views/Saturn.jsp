Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after 
Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has 
only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 
times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical 
symbol represents the god's sickle.
