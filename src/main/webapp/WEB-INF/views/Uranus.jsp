Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and 
fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to 
Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas 
giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as 
"ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to 
Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains 
more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.
It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 
49 K , and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to 
make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of 
Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.
