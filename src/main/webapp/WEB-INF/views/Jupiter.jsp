Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant 
planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the 
other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two 
giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers 
since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.
