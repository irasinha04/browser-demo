Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the 
Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, 
and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more 
massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger 
than Neptune.[d] Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 
30.1 AU (4.5 billion km). It is named after the Roman god of the sea.
