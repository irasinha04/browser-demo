Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered.

Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth 
planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery 
of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the 
scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the 
International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" formally in 2006, during 
their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf 
planet.
