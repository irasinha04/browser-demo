Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the 
longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the 
opposite direction to most other planets (meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set 
in the east). It does not have any natural satellites. It is named after the Roman 
goddess of love and beauty.
